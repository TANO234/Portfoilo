                <h1>WHY IS KIRA WORSHIPPED AS A GOD</h1>
                <p>Kira's ability to eliminate criminals without leaving any trace, combined with his public statements and pronouncements about his <br>
                    mission, gives him a powerful mystique and charisma that draws people to him. <br>
                     followers are also drawn to his intellect, leadership, and the sense of purpose that he brings to their lives.</p>
